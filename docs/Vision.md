Hi! My name is Cameron Bodine and I am the primary developer of PING-Mapper. PING-Mapper has been the focus of my PhD dissertation research in Ecological Informatics at Northern Arizona University. I have wanted to build something like PING-Mapper ever since I started manually mapping substrates following the Kaeser and Litts (2013) method and discovered that there was a possibility of automating many, if not all, of the workflows as demonstrated by Dan Buscombe with his work on PyHum (Buscombe, 2017). With my nearly five year tenure as a graduate student coming to a close in May 2024, I am proud to provide an open-source tool to the aquatic community that several researchers are already using to image and map their study systems. It is because the workflows are transparent, the tools are easy to use, and it requires very little manual intervention by the end user. While these are important improvements to generating benthic datasets from recreation fish finders, there is much more that can be done.
