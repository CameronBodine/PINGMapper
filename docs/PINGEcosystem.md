## Introduction

The [PING Ecosystem](https://github.com/PINGEcosystem) is a growing set of open-source software tools designed to generate scientific datasets from sonar data collected with low-cost recreation-grade sonar systems, or fishfinders. These tools are housed in open-source repositories on GitHub. They are designed to be easy-to-use and require no coding (i.e. Python) expertise.

## Future Development, Collaborations, & Partnerships

Partnerships are essential for the longevity and evolution of these tools and those which do not currently exist. If you are interested in partnering on future developments, please reach out to [Cameron Bodine](https://cameronbodine.github.io/).
