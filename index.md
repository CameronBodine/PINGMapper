`PING-Mapper` transforms recreation-grade sonar systems into scientific data collectors, allowing researchers and citizens alike to reproducibly map their aquatic system with minimal expertise in data processing.

## Overview

### Key Functionality

- Decode Humminbird&reg; (tested on 1197, 1198, 1199, Helix, Solix, Onix).  If it doesn't work for your Humminbird&reg; recording, submit an [Issue](https://github.com/CameronBodine/PINGMapper/issues).  For more information on Humminbird&reg; recording file formats, [read the docs](./docs/advanced/HumFileStructure.html).

- Export all metadata from .DAT and .SON files to .CSV.

- Automatically detect depth (i.e. [Zheng et al. 2021](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/10/1945)) and shadows in side scan channels .

- Correct sonar backscatter with Empiracle Gain Normalization.

- Export un-rectified sonar tiles with water column present (WCP) AND/OR export un-rectified sonograms with water column removed (WCR) using Humminbird depth estimates OR automated depth detections.

- Export speed corrected un-rectified sonograms.

- Smooth and interpolate GPS track points.

- Export georectified WCP (spatially inaccurate due to presence of water column) AND/OR WCR sonar imagery for use in GIS w/wo shadows removed.

- Mosaic georectified sonar imagery.

- Automatically segment and classify substrate patches.

More information on PING-Mapper exports can be found [here](./docs/gettingstarted/Exports.html).

### Compatible Humminbird&reg; Systems

`PING-Mapper` is currently compatible with Humminbird&reg; side imaging sonar systems. The software has been designed to work with any model, but has been specifically tested with the following models:

- 998
- 1198
- 1199
- Helix
- Solix
- Onix

If `PING-Mapper` doesn't work for your Humminbird&reg; recording, submit an [Issue](https://github.com/CameronBodine/PINGMapper/issues).



### Examples

`PING-Mapper` is designed to **decode sonar recordings** from a Humminbird&reg; like this:

*Video made with [HumViewer](https://humviewer.cm-johansen.dk/)*

Export **ping attributes** from each sonar channel including sonar depth, latitude, longitude, vessel speed & heading, etc., to file for further analysis:

And **export georectified mosaics** of the sonar imagery and **automatically generate substrate maps**:
