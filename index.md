# PING-Mapper

`PING-Mapper` is an open-source and freely available software for reading and processing recreation-grade Humminbird&reg; side imaging recordings. `PING-Mapper` turns recreation-grade sonar systems into scientific data collectors, allowing researchers and citizens alike to reproducibly map their aquatic system with minimal expertise in data processing. Functionality includes:

- Decode Humminbird&reg; side imaging sonar recordings from any model;
- Export ping attributes (depth, latitude, longitude, vessel speed & heading, etc.) from every sonar channel;
- Water column removal using the sonar depth;
- Export of sonogram tiles and georectified mosaics.

`PING-Mapper` is actively maintained, with new functionality currently in development. New functionality in the pipeline includes:

- Automatic depth detection
- Automatic substrate classification
- Imagery corrections (radiometric, attenuation, etc.)
- GUI front-end, either as standalone software, or QGIS plugin
- So much more...
