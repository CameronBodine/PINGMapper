# PING-Mapper
{: .fs-9 }

`PING-Mapper` is an open-source software for reading and processing recreation-grade side scan sonar recordings
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

`PING-Mapper` turns recreation-grade sonar systems into scientific data collectors, allowing researchers and citizens alike to reproducibly map their aquatic system with minimal expertise in data processing. 

## Compatible Sonar Systems

`PING-Mapper` is currently compatible with Humminbird&reg; side imaging sonar systems. The software has been designed to work with any model, but has been specifically tested with the following models:

- 998
- 1198
- 1199
- Helix
- Solix
- Onix

## Current Features

- Decode Humminbird&reg; side imaging sonar recordings from any model;
- Export ping attributes (depth, latitude, longitude, vessel speed & heading, etc.) from every sonar channel;
- Water column removal using the sonar depth;
- Export of sonogram tiles and georectified mosaics.

## Examples

`PING-Mapper` is designed to **decode sonar recordings** from a Humminbird&reg; like this:

Export **ping attributes** from each sonar channel including sonar depth, latitude, longitude, vessel speed & heading, etc., to file for further analysis:

And create georectified mosaics of the sonar imagery:

## Future Features

`PING-Mapper` is actively maintained, with new functionality currently in development. New functionality in the pipeline includes:

- Automatic depth detection
- Automatic substrate classification
- Imagery corrections (radiometric, attenuation, etc.)
- GUI front-end, either as standalone software, or QGIS plugin
- So much more...
